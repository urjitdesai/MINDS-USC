            "article_data": "The death toll from a storm that struck three southern African countries rose to 70 on Thursday as emergency teams battled to repair damaged infrastructure and help tens of thousands of victims.Packing torrential rains, Tropical Storm Ana made landfall Monday in Madagascar before ploughing into Mozambique and Malawi.Rescue workers and authorities across the three countries were still assessing the full extent of the damage.Madagascar has reported 41 dead, with 18 others killed in Mozambique and 11 in Malawi.Remnants of the storm have passed over Zimbabwe, but no deaths have been reported there.In the three hardest-hit countries, tens of thousands of homes were damaged. Some collapsed under the heavy rain, trapping victims in the rubble.Bridges were washed away by swollen rivers, while livestock drowned and submerged fields, destroying the livelihoods of rural families.In Madagascar, 110,000 had to flee their homes. In the capital Antananarivo, schools and gyms were turned into emergency shelters.\u201cWe only brought our most important possessions,\u201d Berthine Razafiarisoa, who sheltered in a gym with his family of 10, told AFP news agency.In northern and central Mozambique, Ana destroyed 10,000 homes, dozens of schools and hospitals, and downed power lines.Mozambique\u2019s weather service expects another storm to form over the Indian Ocean in the coming days. Up to six tropical cyclones are expected before the rainy season ends in March.In neighbouring Malawi, the government declared a state of natural disaster.Most of the country lost electricity early in the week, after floodwaters hit generating stations. Power was restored by Thursday in parts of the country, but parts of the electric grid were destroyed.\u201cOur priority now is restoring power to health establishments, water treatment distribution systems, and schools,\u201d the national power utility said in a statement.Southern Africa, and especially Mozambique, has suffered repeated destructive storms in recent years.",

            "article_data": "Rwandan President Paul Kagame has arrived in Mozambique, where he has deployed some 1,000 soldiers to help local security forces tackle fighters wreaking havoc in the country\u2019s north.Attacks by an armed group known locally as al-Shabab, whose origins, analysts say, are steeped in local political, religious and economic discontent, have steadily increased in the Cabo Delgado province since October 2017. The violence, including the raiding of villages and towns, has killed more than 3,306 people \u2013 half of them civilians \u2013 and displaced at least 800,000 from their homes over the past four years.Rwanda in July was the first of several African countries to provide reinforcements to Mozambique\u2019s army, overwhelmed by the worsening conflict in the gas-rich province. A contingent of forces from the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), is also patrolling northern Cabo Delgado.Kagame landed in the provincial capital, Pemba, on Friday morning and was received by his Mozambican counterpart, Filipe Nyusi. The two leaders met and addressed Rwandan troops deployed to the province.President Nyusi welcomes President Kagame to Pemba, Mozambique for a two-day working visit. The Presidents will meet with the Rwandan Joint Forces working with Mozambican Defence Armed Forces in Cabo Delgado, followed by t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate and bilateral meetings and a press conference. pic.twitter.com/5IgFJMRl8f\u2014 Presidency | Rwanda (@UrugwiroVillage) September 24, 2021In a joint news conference, Kagame said Rwandan troops would help secure and rebuild the areas destroyed by the violence.\u201cThe work hasn\u2019t been easy,\u201d Kagame told his soldiers, according to posts on the Rwandan presidency\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cYou have done great work alongside Mozambican troops. You sacrificed and endured days and nights in the scorching sun, heavy rains,\u201d he said.\u201cThe work done so far cannot stop here. We now have another task which is to continue rebuilding and protecting this country.\u201dFor his part, Nyusi called Rwandan troops \u201creal heroes\u201d, adding that Mozambique\u2019s \u201csoldiers are forever indebted to you and we look forward to continuing rebuilding the lives of our citizens for the better\u201d.  \n Foreign forces have helped Mozambique regain ground in Cabo Delago since fighters linked to ISIL (ISIS) launched a coordinated assault on the port town of Palma in March, offsetting multibillion-dollar gas projects and raising international concern.Some local officials have encouraged civilians to return, according to media reports, and the Rwandan military\u2019s spokesman said 25,000 people had been brought home. \u201cIt is very safe for them to go back,\u201d Ronald Rwivanga told Reuters news agency on Thursday.But United Nations officials are not so sure.A document compiled in September for UN agencies and other aid groups, seen by Reuters, said it was not clear whether the fighters\u2019 capabilities had been much reduced. \u201cFighting continues in certain locations and civilian authorities have not been re-established,\u201d it added.Al Jazeera\u2019s Malcolm Webb, reporting from an abandoned town in Cabo Delgado, said the remains of what the fighters had left behind were still visible.\u201cA lot of the buildings have been torched, goods from the shops have been looted, cars have been set on fire as well,\u201d he added.\u201cCivilians in this area really fear the fighters from this armed group. They are notorious for beheadings, for abducting people and all of the villages that we passed along the road are still completely deserted.\u201d  \n Rwivanga said the Rwandans had been moving civilians back into the area they control near a $20bn liquefied natural gas (LNG) project run by oil major TotalEnergies, which was forced to a halt by the Palma attack.Yet security analysts say the Mozambican military deficiencies that allowed the armed campaign to take hold in the north \u2013 including soldiers that are ill-equipped, undisciplined and poorly paid \u2013 will not be easily reversed. Even with other forces there, they say, security is uncertain outside of small, heavily guarded areas.Mozambican and Rwandan forces notched up a major victory in August, when they drove the fighters out of their de facto headquarters in the port city of Mocimboa da Praia.But violence has continued. Local people and security forces have recently reported a string of attacks in Quissanga district, south of Mocimba da Praia, where fighters are believed to have fallen back after the town was retaken. The latest occurred on Thursday evening in the village of Lindi.\u201cTwo people were killed and another two people were injured,\u201d an unnamed police source was quoted as saying by AFP news agency on Friday, adding that fighters had captured several women and girls.Fighters also ambushed two buses transporting soldiers later that night, causing at least one death, a traffic police officer told AFP. The attack took place on a main road that had been closed for two years due to similar incidents, and only recently reopened following the arrival of foreign troops.In total, at least 10 people have been killed across several villages in Quissanga over the past week, another police officer said. Some of the victims were reportedly beheaded.  \n ",

Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi himself has historically been resistant to foreign boots on the ground.Attacks by an armed group known locally as al-Shabab, whose origins, analysts say, are steeped in local political, religious and economic discontent, have steadily increased in the Cabo Delgado province since October 2017.The sophistication of the attacks has increased, too.The ISIL-linked fighters have ransacked towns and gained control of key roadways, destroying infrastructure and beheading civilians.

Nearly half of these forcibly displaced people are children.55 percent of refugees come from three countries: Syria, Palestine and Venezuela.During the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201ceverything else has stopped, including the economies, but wars and conflict and violence and discrimination and persecution, all the factors that pushed these people to flee, have continued,\u201d UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said.In 2020, 1.27 million people from 64 countries became refugees. The infographic below shows the desperate journeys these people took despite the additional challenges brought on by COVID-19.Africa accounts for more than one-third of the world\u2019s displaced people. By the end of 2020, at least 30.6 million people were displaced across the continent.In 2020, nearly 60,000 refugees fled from Ethiopia to neighbouring countries following violence in several parts of the East African country. In November 2020, fighting broke out in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region displacing more than one million people according to the International Organization for Migration.In the Middle East, Syrian refugees continued to flee their country\u2019s 10-year-long war, with nearly 134,000 recorded to have left in 2020. Half of them (65,000) fled to neighbouring Turkey, which now hosts the world\u2019s largest refugee community \u2013 3.7 million people. That same year, nearly a quarter of Syrian refugees (32,500) reached Germany.In Latin America, nearly 400,000 refugees fled Venezuela following a political and economic crisis in the country. Of these, 139,000 were recorded fleeing to Peru, 80,000 to the Dominican Republic and 60,000 to Brazil.In Asia, the UN recorded at least 29,000 refugees from Myanmar. Nearly all of these refugees arrived in neighbouring India (17,000) and Bangladesh (12,000).In Europe, at least 89,000 refugees fled from Azerbaijan to Armenia following 44 days of fighting that broke out between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.Across the Atlantic, during 2020, the United States received 8,500 refugees from 20 countries. Nearly half of these refugees came from only three countries: Venezuela (1,600), El Salvador (1,200), and Guatemala (1,100). This is significantly lower than in 2019 when the country received 32,000 refugees.Canada received 7,500 refugees from 21 countries in 2020. The top countries of origin were Nigeria (1,400), Iran (1,200) and Hungary (629). On the other side of the globe, Australia received only 956 refugees in 2020 \u2013 mostly from Iran.Refugee camps are intended as temporary safe haven to meet refugees\u2019 basic needs. However, many people end up living in these camps for decades. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kenya: \u201cMany displaced persons spend more than 16 years living as refugees in temporary shelter.\u201dThe infographic below highlights some of the largest refugee camps around the world.The Kutupalong camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, is the world\u2019s largest refugee camp. It was set up informally in the early 1990s after Myanmar\u2019s minority Rohingya began to flee several crackdowns on them in Rakhine state.In 2017, brutal crackdowns tore through the state and the camp had to be significantly expanded, reaching a capacity of approximately 800,000 people.On March 22, 2021, a huge fire engulfed a neighbouring refugee camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Fifteen people were killed and tens of thousands were left without their homes and belongings.The Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya comprises three large refugee camps \u2013 Hagadera, Dagahaley and Ifo \u2013 and houses more than 200,000 refugees near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in 1991 following the civil war in Somalia and expanded in 2011 following widespread drought and famine.The Kakuma refugee camp in northwest Kenya is home to at least 150,000 refugees mostly from South Sudan and Somalia. The camp was established in 1992 following the arrival of thousands of Sudanese children who were fleeing the civil war.In March 2021, Kenya\u2019s government announced that it would close the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps by June 30, 2022.The Zaatari refugee camp\u00a0was established in Jordan in 2012 to house Syrian refugees. Today, it is the largest Syrian refugee camp in the world. The world\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccination centre in a refugee camp opened there in February 2021.In 1951, the UN established the 1951 Refugee Convention, set up to protect the rights of refugees in Europe in the aftermath of World War II. In 1967, the convention was expanded to address displacement across the rest of the world.The infographic below highlights 70 years of refugee journeys, from 1951 to 2020. The number of refugees has more than doubled over the past decade from 15 million in 2011 to 30 million in 2020.The plight of Palestinian refugees is the longest unresolved refugee problem in the world. On May 14, 1948, the British Mandate for Palestine expired, triggering the first Arab-Israeli war. Zionist militias expelled at least 750,000 Palestinians. According to figures compiled by UNHCR, by 1952 the number of Palestinian refugees was 867,000. Today, that figure is 5.7 million.Afghanistan has been ravaged by four decades of war. From 1979 to 1989, the country was a stage for one of the Cold War\u2019s last battles as Soviet troops fought a bloody guerrilla war against the Afghan mujahideen. For the next decade, the county struggled on. Just 12 years after the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan would find itself invaded again, this time by the US. The highest number of Afghan refugees was recorded in 1990 where 6.3 million refugees were reported.At 6.7 million people, Syrians are the biggest population of refugees today followed by Palestinians (5.7 million) and Venezuelans (4 million). As of 2020, 88 percent of the world\u2019s refugees originated from only 12 countries.On the receiving end, 65 percent of the world\u2019s refugees are hosted by only 16 countries. Turkey hosts the most refugees (3.7 million) followed by Jordan (3 million) and Colombia (1.7 million).In Europe, Germany is home to about 1.2 million refugees, the highest in the continent.According to UNHCR, developing countries host 86 percent of the world\u2019s refugees.",

In some cases, they have forced locals into their ranks or held them as sex slaves.Since August 2020, the fighters have been in control of the key port town of Mocimboa da Praia, while in March, they launched a coordinated assault on Palma town, killing dozens and forcing more than 67,000 to abandon their homes.A video by the group distributed in August last year \u2013 filmed in either Mozambique or the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to the US-based SITE Intelligence Group \u2013 showed three gun-toting children flanked by adults in front of an ISIL banner.\u201cAbducting a child constitutes one of the six grave violations against children in times of conflict, as defined by the United Nations. It is against international humanitarian law and can be a first step towards war crimes such as forced child conscription or sexual violence against children,\u201d Briggs said.\u201cEvery day spent by abducted children outside their community is one too many, and the risks of abuse, early marriage and pregnancy increase the more time goes by.\u201d  \n Save the Children called for the immediate release of all abducted children and for the perpetrators to be held to account.It said children were sometimes targeted for abduction in large groups, citing one attack where 21 people were abducted in a group, including six children.\u201cIn that same incident, at least seven fishermen were beheaded,\u201d it said.In another attack in June 2020, 10 girls were taken while drawing water from a well, it added.The charity highlighted the recent abduction of a 14-year-old girl following the March 24 attack on Palma. She and her family had in August 2020 fled their fishing village to seek shelter in the town.But seven months later, \u201carmed men entered Palma and forced the family to flee again. On the way to seek safety, the family was abducted by armed men. They all escaped except for their eldest daughter,\u201d it said, citing the teenager\u2019s father.Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had registered more than 2,600 appeals in Mozambique between September 2020 and April 2021 from people who lost track of family members, most of whom are young adults and children.\u201cThere is a very high number of unaccompanied children [who are] extremely vulnerable to all kinds of abuses and exploitation,\u201d said James Matthews, deputy head of the ICRC\u2019s mission in Mozambique\u2019s capital, Maputo.  \n ",

            "article_data": "White contractors were prioritised for evacuation ahead of Black locals during a rescue operation following an attack in March by an armed group known locally as al-Shabab on the Mozambican town of Palma, according to Amnesty International.In a report compiled from interviews with 11 Black survivors, Amnesty on Thursday charged that even dogs were pulled to safety before Black people by a helicopter that airlifted civilians from a hotel where they had sought refuge.\u201cWhite contractors [were] airlifted to safety before local Black people,\u201d said Amnesty, adding the hotel manager took his two German Shepherd dogs on the rescue helicopter, leaving people behind.Dyck Advisory Group (DAG), a South Africa private company hired to help the Mozambique government fight the armed group and which was involved in the rescue operation, rejected the allegations.\u201cWe rescued 24 people from the Amarula Lodge on the 25 March 2021 this consisted of 6 white persons and 18 Black persons of differing nationalities,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u201cThe DAG team did not choose who would or would not be evacuated, they secured the landing site and loaded the people that were sent to them for evacuation by the lodge manager,\u201d it added.Dyck Advisory Group reacts to Amnesty International claims that white expats and dogs were prioritised for evacuation before black Mozambiquans in Palma \"We rescued 24 people from the Amarula Lodge on the 25 March 2021 this consisted of 6 white persons and 18 black persons\" pic.twitter.com/lRBOajooG6\u2014 Will Brown (@_Will_Brown) May 14, 2021Some 200 people, mainly civil servants and foreigners working on a nearby gas project, sheltered in the Amarula Palma Hotel during the attack on Palma that began on March 24.Amnesty said there were about 20 white workers among the group holed up in the beachfront hotel.\u201cWhile the white contractors were prioritised to be airlifted to safety, the Black nationals were left to fend for themselves. After the majority of the white contractors and a few well-off Black nationals \u2013 among them the Administrator for Palma \u2013 were rescued, those left behind attempted to flee by ground convoy\u201d but were ambushed by al-Shabab, Amnesty said.Deprose Muchena, the rights watchdog\u2019s regional director for east and southern Africa, said \u201cthese are alarming allegations that the rescue plan was racially segregated.\u201d\u201cAbandoning people during an armed assault simply because of the colour of their skin is racism, and violates the obligation to protect civilians,\u201d he said, adding that for the hotel manager to \u201cchoose to rescue his dogs instead of people is also extremely shocking\u201d.One survivor told Amnesty that \u201cwe didn\u2019t want all white people to be rescued, because we knew that if all the whites left, we would be left there to die. We heard them talking about the plan to take all the whites and leave\u201d the Black people.  \n But a white survivor, South African Wesley Nel, whose brother died in the attack, denied the discrimination claims.\u201cI was there. We all were abandoned black and white,\u201d tweeted Nel, whose brother Adrian Nel was killed during a deadly ambush of a convoy of cars trying to flee from the hotel.\u201cBut it was us \u2018white\u2019 people who saved 150 locals by driving us all out of there,\u201d he wrote on Twitter following the publication of the report.Several witnesses also told Amnesty the hotel manager took advantage of the chaotic situation to take his two German Shepherd dogs to safety via helicopter, leaving people behind. The helicopters could only transport six people at a time, and made a total of four trips, the rights group said.\u201cIf the dogs hadn\u2019t gone, about two or three more people could have gone on the helicopter,\u201d one survivor said. \u201cThat dismayed people because some women didn\u2019t get in the helicopter because of the dogs.\u201dTwelve decapitated bodies were found strewn in front of the hotel days after the attack, according to the army and private security sources.The attack on Palma left dozens of Mozambicans and foreigners dead, according to the government, and displaced tens of thousands.It marked a major intensification in a conflict that has wreaked havoc across Cabo Delgado province for more than three years.",
